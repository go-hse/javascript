Closures are used frequently in JavaScript, especially in more complex programs such as event handlers, asynchronous operations, and functional programming patterns.\n",

        "Closures are often used to **encapsulate data** and simulate private variables. Since JavaScript does not have a native way to create private variables in functions, closures can be used to hide data from the outside world.\n",
